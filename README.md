# ðŸŽ¯ Placement Detection Model

This project is a Machine Learning-based system to **predict whether a student is placed or not** based on their academic performance. It is designed to help academic institutions and training departments support students in their placement preparation journey.

---
## ðŸ“Š Dataset Overview

- The dataset contains academic details of students such as:
  - **CGPA**
  - **Aptitude Score**
  - **Placement Status** (target label: placed or not)

---

## ðŸš€ Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Logistic Regression model for binary classification
- Prediction based on trained model

---

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Model Training

The model is trained using **Logistic Regression**.  
The training process includes:

- Feature engineering
- Train-test split
- Model evaluation using accuracy

---

## ðŸ“Œ Use Case

This tool can be used by:

- **Colleges/Universities** to predict student placement outcomes
- **Training & Placement Cells** to identify students needing support
- **Students** to evaluate their readiness based on CGPA and aptitude
